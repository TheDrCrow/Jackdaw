<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>Chronic rhinosinusitis with failure of medical management.</p>
<p>Coronal volume CT of the sinuses with multiplanar reconstructions in sinus and soft tissue.</p> 
<p>Standard sinus CT supplemented with post-contrast views.</p>
<p>Comparison is made with the previous from xxx, which showed xxx</p>
<p>There is significant image degradation due to metal artefact which limits this investigation xxx.</p>
<p>There is a fair amount of motion artefact throughout the scan.</p>
<hr class="subsection">
<h6>Surgical Change</h6>
<p>Note is made of prior operative procedures with removal of the xxx.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Normals and Near Normals</h5>
<p>There are no fluid levels nor significant mucosal thickening seen with a reasonably normal anatomy and no bone loss or sclerosis.<br>
No polyps nor masses seen either. No sign of sinonasal pathology.</p> 
<p>There is only rather minor mucosal thickening and a little fluid / seen in xxx. This is unlikely to be due to significant rhinosinusitis.</p>
<p>There is ipsilateral enlargement of the mucosa of the xxx ethmoid and nose without significant proximal hypertrophy. 
This is more likely to be due to transient physiological change than pathology.</p>
<p>No acute abnormality seen with relative normal mucosa, no significant fluid levels, no new bone change and no other sign of acute abnormality.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Inflammation & Pattern</h5>
<p>There is just a little opacification and some polypoid mucosal thickening in the xxx which might represent rhinosinusitis.</p>
<p>There is xxx opacification noted in the xxx sinuses with some asymmetric mucosal thickening air-fluid levels and bubbly secretions in keeping with rhinosinusitis.</p>
<p>There is new bone formation, sclerosis and reduction in volume in the xxx sinus in keeping with long-standing chronic rhinosinusitis.</p>
<p>There are multiple polyps in the xxx with some opacification and probable obstruction of the xxx.</p>
<p>The xxx inflammatory changes in the anterior ethmoidal air cells as well as the frontal and maxillary sinuses is in keeping with an <span class ="greyongreenblue">ostiomeatal complex pattern.</span></p>
<hr class="subsection">
<h6>Patterns</h6>
<p>The xxx inflammatory changes in the frontal sinuses alone suggests a <b>frontal recess inflammatory 
pattern</b>.</p>
<p>The isolated opacification of the xxx maxillary sinus is in keeping with an <span class ="greyongreenblue">infundibular pattern</span>.</p>
<p>The inflammatory changes in the xxx sphenoid and posterior ethmoidal cells is in keeping with a <span class="greyonlightblue">sphenoethmoidal pattern</span></p>
<p>The widespread polyps and multiple obstructive changes, excluding the inferior meatus. As well as xxx maxillary infundibular widening and this is in keeping with a sinonasal polyposis pattern.</p>
<p>It is not possible to apply a specific pattern to the inflammatory change thus it is in keeping with a sporadic pattern.</p>
<p>The xxx frontal sinus is completely opacified and there is fairly marked expansion of the sinus by a homogenous low attenuation lesion. There is associated bone thinning and expansion of the sinus and the appearances suggest a <span class="greyonmediumblue">mucocele.</span></p>
<p>There is a bony defect between the xxx maxillary sinus and the mouth in keeping with a oroantral fistula the wall of which is xxx.</p>
      
<hr class = "subsection">      
<text>Bone Changes: 'Pressure deossifiaction' thinning and bone loss usually with some bony remodelling
at the edges; mostly due to slower growing inflamm lesions and occ slow growing neoplasms inc melanoma. 'Destruction'= mostly neoplasms which are aggressive
and rarely inflammatory. 'Sclerosis' mostly in chronic relapsing information.</text>
<text>Calcification: Mostly in chronic inflammation. If in a tumour think of chondrosarcoma or olfactory neuroblastoma</text>
<hr>
<h5>Explanation</h5>
<p>There are no Haller cells, polyps nor other clear cause for this infundibular pattern and it appears to be due to mucosal thickening.</p> 
<p>There is no nasal septal deviation, concha bullosa, paradoxical middle turbinate nor turbinate hypertrophy to explain the pattern. No masses seen either.</p>
<p>The middle turbinate is not significantly lateralised nor are there any significant frontal recess cells.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Other Infections</h5>
<p>There are multiple opacified sinuses with expansion and some hyperdense on a background of chronic sinusitis and polyposis and the appearances are in keeping with <span class="greyonlightblue">allergic fungal sinusitis.</span></p> 
<p>There is xxx low T1 and low T2 signal abnormality filling out the xxx sinuses with some bony expansion. These regions demonstrate thin peripheral enhancement and the appearances are in keeping with <span class="greyonlightblue">allergic fungal sinusitis</span>.</p>
<p>There is a mass filling out the xxx. It has central regions of high density and calcification which is notably central and punctate and the appearances suggest a <span class="greyonmediumblue">mycetoma</span>.</p>
<p>There is an aggressive appearing mass centred in the xxx but extending beyond the lumen into the xxx with noticeable bone erosion. His clinical state and the presence of immunocompromise / DM makes an <span class="greyonlightblue">acute fulminant fungal sinusitis</span> likely.</p>
<p>This mass is rather oddly lacking in enhancement and low on T1 / T2 ('black turbinate') which is suggestive of a <span class="greyonlightblue">mucormycosis</span></p>
<p>There are rather non-specific chronic rhinosinusitic changes in the xxx. However note is made of bone erosion and soft tissue infiltration into the xxx. I note the long clinical course assume he is immunocompetent; as such a <span class="greyonlightblue">chronic invasive or granulomatous fungal sinusitis</span> should be considered.</p>
<hr>
<h5>Other Inflammatory Findings</h5>
<p>There is mucosal thickening with bone destruction and possibly neo-osteogenesis. This process appears to have started in the midline with nasal septal perforation and destruction of the medial walls of the maxillary sinuses. This is suggestive of <span class="greyongreen">Sinonasal granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Wegeners)</span></p> 
<p>There is perforation of the osteocartilaginous structures of the nasal septum with erosion of the xxx inferior turbinate. No significant soft tissue is seen and the appearances are in keeping with <span class="greyonlightblue">nasal cocaine necrosis</span></p>
<p>Differential includes Sarcoid - with nodular soft tissue +/- anosmia, Lymphoma and Rare (= leprosy, syph + TB.)</p>
<p>There is reduction in the size of the xxx maxillary antrum with in bowing of the walls and opacification of the internal space and outlet. The appearances suggest a <span class="greyongreenblue">silent sinus.</span></p>
<p>Smooth soft tissue attenuation polypoid masses are seen in the xxx sinuses and are not causing obstruction to ouflow and are in keeping with <span class="greyonmediumblue">mucous retention cysts or possibly solitary polyp.</span></p>
<p>There is a dumbbell-shaped low attenuation lesion is seen extending through and expanding the xxx maxillary ostium from the maxillary sinus into the nasal cavity. The appearances are those of a <span class="greyonlightblue">antrochoanal polyp</span></p>
<p>There are widespread soft tissue attenuation polypoid masses filling out the sinonasal space with benign appearing bone remodelling and erosion with effacement of many of the sinus walls especially in the ethmoid sinuses. The maxillary ostia are xxx widened and the appearances are in keeping with extensive <span class = "greyonlightblue">sinonasal polyposis.</span></p>
<hr>
<h5>Critical Findings</h5>
<h6>Normals</h6>
<p>The laminae papyracea, skull base, cribiform plate, optic nerves, anterior ethmoid arteries and ICAs are all unremarkable with no Onodi cells nor other significant anatomic abnormalities seen.</p>
<p>The laminae papyracea and the ethmoid skull base appear intact. The cribiform plate
is anatomically symmetrical. The optic nerves and ICAs are both adequately covered with bone and the anterior ethmoid arteries are in the skull base. No Onodi cells idenitified.</p>
<p>The optic nerves and ICAs are both adequately covered with bone and the anterior 
ethmoid arteries are safely in the skull base.</p>
<hr class="subsection">
<h6>Abnormals</h6>
<p>The cribiform plate is asymmetrical and there is a Keros grade II / III olfactory recess on the xxx. ( I xxx of Cors).</p>
<hr>
<h5>Neoplasms: Benign</h5>
<p>There is a, well defined xxx cm wide lesion in the floor of the frontal sinus consisting entirely of compact bone. There is no obstructive change related to it and the appearances are of a <b>osteoma</b></p>
<p>There is an ill-defined region of bone expansion but not destruction involving the maxillary sinus with a hazy, ground-glass attenuation
and decreased T1 / heterogenous T2. It enhances heterogenously. There is no obstruction and the appearances are in keeping
with <b>fibrous dysplasia.</b> </p>
<p>There is a an expansile mass in the maxilla with central soft-tissue attenuation but with a ossified rim. It is reminiscent of fibrous dysplasia
but the appearances suggest an <b>ossifying fibroma.</b></p>
<p>There is a mass centred in the middle meatus and extending into the maxillary antrum by a widened ostium. There is
extensive bone change with areas of hyperostosis and sclerosis as well as loss and the tumour contains regions of 
calcification. It enhances xxx and the appearances suggest an <b>inverted papilloma</b>.</p>
<p>This lesion is low/intermediate T1 and intermediate / high on T2. It xxx an 'convoluted cerebriform pattern on T2 and post Gd. 
It enhances heterogenously and the appearances suggest an <b>inverted papilloma</b></p>
<p>There is a lobular mass in the nasopharynx, centred around the sphenopalatine foramen. It demonstrates clear invasion into the pteryopalatine fossa.
There is xxx invasion of the xxx infratemporal fossa, sphenoid sinus, orbit and the cranium. The appearances suggest
a juvenile angiofibroma.</p>
<p>There is a cyst/mass extending into the sinonasal region from the maxillary alveolus / plate. There is a double
 cortical line seen in the xxx in keeping with this being a <b>odontogenic lesion.</b></p>
